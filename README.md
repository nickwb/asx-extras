Supplementary data relating to the ASX (Australian Securities Exchange)

## `trading_holidays.json`
* A list of days where the ASX did not (or will not) trade.
* Does not include weekends. Assume every Saturday and Sunday is also a non-trading day.
* Currently covers 1997-2037.
* No guarantee of accuracy! Some guesswork is involved for dates in the future, and I have had some difficulty confirming a few dates in the past. See `trading_holidays.todo` for more details.
